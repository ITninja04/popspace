			<h3 class="margin_bottom_small">Dear fellow Tilde users,</h3>
            <div class="text_two_columns">
                <p class="margin_bottom_small">Thank you so much to everybody who used Tilde, and helped us along the journey.</p>
                
                <p class="margin_bottom_small">We learned a lot from you, and we are greateful that you used the product we built with passion.</p>
                
                <p class="margin_bottom_small">However, Tilde was a very broad proposition. We set up to build a great virtual space for people to meet, brainstorm, communicate, work, have fun, or just feel the presence of each other during a time where everybody was disconnected from each other. During the time it was needed the most.</p>
                
                <p class="margin_bottom_small">Unfortunately, that also means it was hard for us to decide what to build next, and what to focus on.</p>
                
                <p class="margin_bottom_small">This is why we decided to refocus our effort on a very specific use-case: making the best workshops plateform possible. For that, we created a new domain, <a href="https://popstage.com" target="_blank">PopStage.com</a>, and we encourage any of your who used Tilde for workshop to contact us and help us build an even better tool for you.</p>

                <p class="margin_bottom_small">I encourage you to read our FAQ below for all the questions you might have.</p>

                <p>Thanks again for everything.</p>

        <div class="text_two_columns">
            <p class="faq_question">Can I access my rooms until December 15, 2021?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">Yes, if you have a room bookmarked, or a calendar meeting with a Tilde room, you will still be able to access it until December 15th, 2021.</p>

            <p class="faq_question">Can I still create new rooms?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">We disabled the creation of new rooms.</p>

            <p class="faq_question">When will my rooms be closed?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">Your rooms will be closed on December 15th, 2021, along with the rest of the service.</p>

            <p class="faq_question">What will happen to my content?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">All the content in your rooms (sticky notes, files, whiteboard, notepads, etc.) will be deleted on December 15th, 2021. We recommend you download all the content you want to save.</p>

            <p class="faq_question">How do I save my content?</p>
            <p>The simplest way is to join your room, and manually save all the content.</p>
            <p>For files, click on them to redownload them.</p>
            <p>For Whiteboards,click on the download button in the top right to download the whiteboard as a PNG.</p>
            <p>For Sticky notes and Notepads, the only way is to copy paste their content in another software.</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">If your rooms contain a lot of content and you would like help getting everything back, <a href="mailto:support@with.so">contact us</a> and we will help you.</p>
            
            <p class="faq_question">What about the browser extensions?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">The browser extensions have been decommissioned. If they are not automatically removed from your browser, you can right click on the extension and select "Uninstall Tilde".</p>

            <p class="faq_question">What about the slack extension?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">The slack extensions has been decommissioned. To remove it from Slack, a workspace administrator will have to click on "Manage Apps", select Tilde, click on the Configuration tab, and click the "Remove App" button.</p>

            <p class="faq_question">What are you going to do next?</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom">Tilde has been used for bootcamps, workshops, training sessions, etc. While the experience was good, we believe we can really make a difference, by providing an experience dedicated to the task of moderating and facilitating. You can learn more at <a href="https://popstage.com" target="_blank">PopStage.com</a></p>
